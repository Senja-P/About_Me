# About_Me

Hi, I am Senja, a creative and innovative Data Analyst with more than 10 years of experience in PMO (Programme Management Office) roles in fast-paced complex Agile and Waterfall IT programmes in London (UK). PMO roles have included analysing finance, resource and project data and gathering requirements from various stakeholders. My accurate and meaningful status updates, critical insights and process improvements have helped senior management teams and other stakeholders work more efficiently and make informed decisions. 

In 2021 I wanted to develop my analytical skills and learned to implement statistical methods and use analytic tools and techniques.

### My key skills are; 
-	Data Analysis process from start to finish; defining the goals, selecting, cleaning and analysing data. Presenting the findings and insights
-	Basic use of statistical methods in practise; hypothesis and correlation testing
-	Use of SQL queries, Python scripts and Excel
-	Story telling, status reports and data visualisations in Tableau and Power Point
-	Ability to pay attention to details without losing the sight of the big picture

I work equally well on my own initiative and as part of a team. ‘Can do’ attitude, solution-driven mindset and proactive approach come naturally to me. 

### Currently looking for a job opportunity
I am passionate about human behaviour and I am now looking for a role where I can use my problem solving, analytical and visualisation skills  to help colleagues to get accurate, meaningful and easily understandable information and assist business to make good decisions. I am particularly interested in those roles which enable me to analyse people’s activities, attitudes, patterns and performances in the field of consumer behaviour or website navigations.

I’m currently available for both contract and permanent roles. I would prefer to work from home 4 days a week, but I am open for full time opportunities and hybrid work arrangements in London and South East England.
