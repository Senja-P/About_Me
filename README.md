# About_Me

Hi, I am Senja, a creative and highly organised Data Analyst and Resource & Project Specialist with more than 10 years of experience in PMO (Programme Management Office) roles in fast-paced complex Agile and Waterfall IT programmes in London (UK). PMO roles have included analysing finance, resource and project data and gathering requirements from various stakeholders. My accurate and meaningful status updates, critical insights and process improvements have helped senior management teams and other stakeholders work more efficiently and make informed decisions. 

In 2021 I wanted to develop my analytical skills. I learned to implement statistical methods and use analytic tools and techniques; SQL, Python, Excel and Tableau, and I am looking forward to bringing these skills to my new role.

### My key skills are; 
-	Data Analysis process from start to finish; defining the goals, selecting, cleaning and analysing data. Presenting the findings and insights
-	Basic use of statistical methods in practise; hypothesis and correlation testing
-	Use of SQL queries, Python scripts and Excel
-	Storytelling, status reports and data visualisations in Tableau and Power Point
-	Ability to pay attention to details without losing the sight of the big picture

I work equally well on my own initiative and as part of a team. ‘Can-do’ attitude, solution-driven mindset and proactive approach come naturally to me. 

I am interested in roles where I can use my problem solving, analytical and visualisation skills to help colleagues to get accurate, meaningful and easily understandable information and assist business to make good decisions. I am passionate about data and human behaviour and fascinated by the impact of data on business operations. I am particularly interested in those roles which enable me to analyse people related activities, patterns, trends and performances. Hoping to blend my newfound analysis and visualisation skills with existing project data management and business knowledge. I am currently learning Google Analytics and Power BI and improving my Tableau skills.

I’m available for both contract and permanent roles in the UK. I would prefer to work flexibly at home or through hybrid work arrangements in London and South East England.
